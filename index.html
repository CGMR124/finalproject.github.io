   <div class="story">By far one of the oldest houses in Westeros, the Stark line stretches back over 8,000 years with the blood of the first men flowing through their veins. The Starks are a hardy people that rule over the vast regions of the North from their homestead, the castle of Winterfell.
Before the Targaryens ruled Westeros, the leaders of House Stark governed their own region giving themselves the titles “Kings in the North”. When the Targaryens began conquering Westeros, King Torrhen Stark marched his army towards the south to face them in battle. Upon seeing the Targaryens
massive host as well as three huge dragons, Torrhen Stark surrendered, thereafter being named “the king who knelt”.

    <div class="storytargaryen">Perhaps one of if not the most famous house in all of Westeros, the Targaryens were a noble family from Valyria, an empire spanning most of the eastern continent.
After the great fall of Valyria (know as the doom of Valyria) House Targaryen made a name for themselves by invading Westeros in a way unlike anyone has ever seen, riding a top three dragons to spearhead their invasion. The Targaryens were ruthless and in a relatively short period of time, six of the seven kingdoms surrendered to the Targaryen king, Aegon.
The Targaryens believe in keeping their bloodline “pure” by means of inbreeding. As a result, the Targaryens are frequently mentally unstable earning the phrase: “Every time a Targaryen is born, the gods flip a coin.”

    <div class="story">Founded by Orys Baratheon, a general in service to King Aegon the 1st, House Baratheon was formed after Orys defeated Argliac the Arrogant, the last of the Storm Kings. Although one of the youngest houses in Westeros, house Baratheon has already made a strong name for itself.
The Great Rebellion, led by Robert Baratheon and accompanied by Houses Stark, Arryn and Tully, were responsible for defeating the Targaryen army and ending the reign of Aerys Targaryen the 2nd, also know as the “mad king”.  In doing so Robert Baratheon took his place on the iron throne, making house Baratheon become the royal house of Westeros, ruling over its kingdoms.

    <div class="mottolannister">"Hear Me Roar!"</div>
    <div class="storylannister">One of the richest, most influential and powerful houses in all of Westeros, the Lannisters rose to power through ruthlessness and cunning. Their lands reside in the west, ruling from Casterly Rock. They owe their wealth to the fact that their homestead sits a top one of the most productive gold mines in the Westerlands.
The Lannisters earned their sinister reputation largely through the actions of Tywin Lannister, the head of House Lannister. When King’s Landing came under siege, instead of defending the city and the house they swore allegiance to (House Targaryen), they betrayed Aegon Targaryen, the current king of Westeros, and murdered him in his own throne room. The brutality didn’t stop there. After they slew the reigning king, they murdered the Targaryen children in cold blood to ensure that no Targaryen heir would challenge the new royal house of Westeros, The Baratheons.

Masters of the sea, the Greyjoy’s have blood dating back to the Grey King, a famous King of the Iron Islands who, according to legend, took a mermaid for a wife and reigned for over a thousand years.

    <div class="storymartell">House Martell rules from Dorne, a city in the far south of the continent from their castle named Sunspear. Dorne is a arid, humid desert that few houses could withstand let alone reside in, but House Martell has lived there successfully for hundreds of years.
House Martell is the only great house that remains unconquered by any and all invaders, including the Targaryen invaders, earning them the house motto: “Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken”. Over a thousand years ago when Mors Martell fell in love with the warrior-queen Nymeria, they created a marriage alliance. With their combined armies, they conquered and unified the rest of Dorne. House Martell has ruled ever since.
